# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
What is customer segmentation ?

Customer segmentation is a way to split customers into groups based on certain characteristics that those customers share. All customers share the common need of your product or service, but beyond that, there are distinct demographic differences (i.e., age, gender) and they tend to have additional socio-economic, lifestyle, or other behavioral differences that can be useful to the organization.

Why segment customers ?

Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets. Those efforts can relate to both communications and product development. Specifically, segmentation helps a company: Create and communicate targeted marketing messages that will resonate with specific groups of customers, but not with others (who will receive messages tailored to their needs and interests, instead).Select the best communication channel for the segment, which might be email, social media posts, radio advertising, or another approach, depending on the segment.

The dataset contains 541909 records of transactional data with 8 features. The dataset had a good number of duplicated records and missing values which was dropped before moving on to the visualizations.

The main objective of analyzing this data is to predict the valuation of the customers towards the products they are purchasing like which is customers are highly valued customers and which are the less valued one.

RFM Segmentation & Analysis:
Recency, frequency and monetary value is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a company’s or an organization’s best customers by measuring and analyzing spending habits.

The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:

● Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase

● Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase

● Monetary: How much money a customer spends on purchases
RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5. The best customers would receive a top score in every category. These three RFM factors can be used to reasonably predict how likely or unlikely it is that a customer will do business again with a firm or company. RFM analysis allows a comparison between potential customers or clients. It gives organizations a sense of how much revenue comes from repeat customers vs new customers, and which levers they can pull to try to make customers happier so they become repeat purchasers. Despite the useful information that is acquired through RFM analysis, firms must take into consideration that even the best customers will not want to be over solicited, and the lower ranking customers may be cultivated with additional marketing efforts.
